I'm so glad after finish this project. Because, honestly speaking this was one of my hard work since I start to the world of programming language. The reason was that. I was really like to be a front end developer but because I'm in need with money so this job takes me to deal with backend too. `Yeah I know ` most of you Might see like a simple project because your familiar with those framework.. 
## It's true 
Because even for me now it quite simple. I brilliant on doing that, In this project I work with Frontend and Backend as I mentioned ealier.
### For FRONTEND WORK
1. Here I use `React` Javascript Framework to deal with front [React website](https://reactjs.org) 
2. Deployment was on [Netilfy.com](https://www.netlify.com)

### For BACKEND WORK
1. I use to run with `Strapi` as my database [Strapi Website](https://strapi.io)
2. `Cloudinary Server` for Streamline media management and improve user experience by automatically delivering images and videos, enhanced and optimized for every user [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com)
3. Database deployment, Here I mean server for strapi. I use render cloud for deployment [Render Cloud](https://render.com)
